# - Check for the presence of NETCDF
#
# NetCDF is a set of software libraries and self-describing, machine-independent
# data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented
# scientific data.
#
# The following variables are set when NETCDF is found:
# NETCDF_FOUND = Set to true, if all components of NETCDF have been found.
# NETCDF_INCLUDES = Include path for the header files of NETCDF
# NETCDF_LIBRARIES = Link these to use NETCDF
# NETCDF_LFLAGS = Linker flags (optional)
